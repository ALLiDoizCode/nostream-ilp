nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper privilege management with CAP_NET_ADMIN and su-exec for privilege dropping. No command injection vectors. Safe environment variable defaults."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient network verification with 100-packet ping tests. Proper use of Promise.all for parallelization. Cleanup uses stdio: ignore to avoid buffering overhead."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling with set -e in bash scripts. Comprehensive cleanup mechanisms prevent test interference. Proper healthcheck configuration."

      scenarios:
        - "Baseline (no simulation) - AC 1, 7"
        - "Latency simulation (50ms, 100ms, 200ms) - AC 2"
        - "Packet loss simulation (1%, 5%, 10%) - AC 3"
        - "Jitter simulation (10ms, 20ms) - AC 4"
        - "Combined conditions (latency + jitter + packet loss) - AC 2-4"
        - "Performance impact measurement - AC 8"
      status: "All acceptance criteria covered"

code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Clean separation of concerns across scripts, entrypoint, verification, and tests"
    - "Comprehensive error handling with informative error messages"
    - "Proper use of TypeScript interfaces and type guards"
    - "Bash best practices: set -e, safe defaults, exit codes"
    - "Excellent documentation with examples, troubleshooting, and API reference"
    - "Proper cleanup mechanisms using stdio: ignore and error suppression"

  areas_for_improvement: []

security_analysis:
  privilege_escalation: "SAFE - Container starts as root for tc setup, then drops to node user via su-exec"
  command_injection: "SAFE - No user input passed directly to shell commands"
  input_validation: "SAFE - Environment variables have safe defaults (:-0ms, :-0%)"
  container_isolation: "SAFE - Network simulation scoped per-container, doesn't affect host"

performance_analysis:
  expected_impact:
    baseline: "~10ms propagation, 1000+ events/sec"
    latency_50ms: "~60ms propagation, ~500 events/sec"
    packet_loss_5pct: "~10-50ms propagation, ~950 events/sec"
    combined: "~40-70ms propagation (50ms + 10ms jitter + 2% loss), ~450 events/sec"

  verification_efficiency: "100 ping packets provides statistical accuracy without excessive delay"

  optimization_opportunities:
    - "Network verification could be parallelized across multiple node pairs for faster startup"

architecture_patterns:
  patterns_used:
    - "Two-phase initialization (privileged setup, then privilege drop)"
    - "Fail-fast error handling (set -e in bash)"
    - "Verification-before-execution (network conditions verified before tests run)"
    - "Cleanup-on-exit (automatic tc qdisc removal)"

  design_quality: "Excellent - follows infrastructure testing best practices"

documentation_quality:
  completeness: "Excellent - NETWORK_SIMULATION.md covers usage, API, troubleshooting, and examples"
  clarity: "Excellent - Clear examples for satellite, mobile, and congested network scenarios"
  maintainability: "Excellent - JSDoc comments on all public functions with param/return documentation"

implementation_notes:
  - "Uses Linux tc (traffic control) with netem qdisc for network emulation"
  - "Requires CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for tc command"
  - "Network verification uses ping tests with tolerances: ±10% latency, ±2% packet loss, ±3ms jitter"
  - "Cleanup function removes tc qdisc rules to prevent test interference"
  - "Environment variables: NETWORK_LATENCY, NETWORK_JITTER, NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS"
