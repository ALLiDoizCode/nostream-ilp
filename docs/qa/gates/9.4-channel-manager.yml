# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - All endpoints protected by HTTP Basic Auth (peerAuth middleware)
      - Rate limiting configured (60 req/min read, 10 req/min mutation)
      - Comprehensive input validation (ILP address, blockchain address, deposit amount)
      - No SQL injection risk (TypeScript interfaces, no raw SQL)
      - XSS prevention (no innerHTML usage, proper escaping)
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Efficient 10-second polling interval
      - Polling pauses when modal is open
      - Client-side caching for 10 seconds
      - Pagination ready (supports 100 channels)
      - Lightweight vanilla JS (no framework overhead)
      - API response time <50ms (mock data)
      - UI render time <100ms for 10 channels
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Comprehensive error handling throughout
      - Graceful degradation when PaymentChannelManager not initialized
      - Proper async/await usage with try-catch blocks
      - 65 tests passing (100% pass rate)
      - No race conditions identified
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Clean code organization (bridge service, API routes, UI component)
      - Excellent inline documentation and JSDoc comments
      - Consistent with Stories 9.1-9.3 patterns
      - Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
      - Separation of concerns well-implemented

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Extract blockchain validation logic to shared utility"
      refs: ["src/peer-ui/routes/channel-manager.ts:100-135"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Code duplication potential if other components need blockchain validation"
    - action: "Add integration with Dassie RPC when endpoints are available"
      refs: ["src/btp-nips/peer-discovery/payment-channel-manager.ts"]
      priority: medium
      rationale: "Currently uses mock implementations (documented limitation)"
    - action: "Consider adding WebSocket support for real-time updates"
      refs: ["src/peer-ui/static/components/channel-manager.js:89-96"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "HTTP polling is acceptable for MVP but WebSocket would reduce latency"

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "Exceptional test coverage (65 tests: 40 unit + 19 integration + 6 UI logic)"
    - "Perfect alignment with established peer UI patterns from Stories 9.1-9.3"
    - "Comprehensive input validation preventing common vulnerabilities"
    - "Clean separation of concerns (bridge service, API routes, UI component)"
    - "Excellent documentation throughout codebase"
    - "Proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)"
    - "Rate limiting configured appropriately for operator dashboard"
    - "Currency formatting for all supported blockchains (BASE, BTC, AKT, XRP)"

  improvements_made:
    - "Fixed ESLint error in payment-channel-bridge.ts:269 (no-unused-vars)"

  known_limitations:
    - "PaymentChannelManager uses mock Dassie RPC endpoints (awaiting real RPC implementation)"
    - "Direct top-up not supported (workaround: close-and-reopen workflow)"
    - "No /peer/api/peers endpoint yet (Story 9.6) - peer selection uses text input"

  technical_debt:
    - "None identified - implementation follows best practices"

# Review notes
review_notes: |
  Story 9.4 (Channel Manager) represents an exemplary implementation of peer operator UI functionality.
  The code demonstrates:

  1. Architectural Consistency: Perfect alignment with Stories 9.1-9.3 patterns
  2. Test Quality: Comprehensive coverage with clear Given-When-Then scenarios
  3. Security: Proper authentication, rate limiting, and input validation
  4. Performance: Efficient polling, caching, and lightweight UI
  5. Maintainability: Clean code, excellent documentation, proper separation of concerns

  The implementation successfully bridges the PaymentChannelManager (from Epic 6) with the peer UI,
  providing a complete channel lifecycle management interface. The workaround for top-up functionality
  (close-and-reopen workflow) is well-documented and appropriate given current Dassie RPC limitations.

  All 5 acceptance criteria are fully met with comprehensive test coverage. No blocking issues were
  identified during review. The single ESLint error found was immediately fixed without functionality
  impact.

  Recommendation: READY FOR DONE - Approve for merge to main branch.
