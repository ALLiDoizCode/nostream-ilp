nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All endpoints protected with peerAuth middleware (HTTP Basic Auth). Input validation for ILP addresses, filters, and TTL. Rate limiting: 60/min read, 20/min write."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "HTTP polling at 10s intervals (appropriate for subscription data). Pauses during modal interactions. Efficient DOM updates with silent reloads."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks. All errors logged with debug statements. Graceful degradation for missing SubscriptionManager."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented code with JSDoc comments. Clear separation of concerns (bridge service, API routes, UI component). Consistent patterns from Stories 9.1 & 9.2."
