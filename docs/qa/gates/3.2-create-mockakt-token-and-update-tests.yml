nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All critical security scenarios tested (signature verification, nonce replay prevention, balance overflow protection, double-close prevention, expiration enforcement, input validation). Contract inherits OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard. ERC-20 transfers properly wrapped in require() from Story 3.1 QA fix."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Test execution: 722ms for 29 tests (~25ms per test). No flaky tests. Gas profiling deferred to Story 3.4 as planned."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling coverage (all 7 custom errors tested). State consistency validated. Recovery mechanisms tested (channel expiration refund)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation (test/README.md with 296 lines). Clean code structure with helper functions and constants. Easy to understand and modify."
